# await-exec

Small promise wrapper around node's `child_process#exec` allowing you to use async/await syntax for commands you want to execute.

## Usage
```js
const exec = require('await-exec')

async function logger (text) {
  await exec(`echo ${text}`)
}

for (let k = 0; k < 10; k++) {
  logger('worked!')
}
```

Optinally you can pass a second `Object` that will get directly passed to cp#exec
